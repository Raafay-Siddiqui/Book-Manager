So to use the program its incredibly simple and intuitive. 

For the .py, 
1) download it to your computer from github

1.5) make sure you have python installed on your computer. 
If you're on a windows computer you can go to the microsoft store
and download it there. - https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NRWMJP3717K
Or you can go on https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download it there
(download the latest stable version)

2) move it to a folder or create a new folder.

3) double click to open.

4) to use fill out the required fields and click "Add Book".

5) you can sort the books by clicking on status button and then putting it on which mode(s) you want.
then click on "Sort By Status" and it will show you which books you have read, not read, or are reading.


*so if you double-click the file and it just opens and closes the way to fix it is just to do these thing(s):

make a text file in the same folder with the books.py file.

in the  text file put this:

python "C:\Users\name\Desktop\Books\books.py"


put the route to the file in that section above^

so once you've made save it as a bat file.
e.g. books.bat and make sure its set to all files
