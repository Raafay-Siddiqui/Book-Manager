# Book-Manager
A very lightweight book manager to store books on your computer.
So the purpose of this book manager is just so you can store it locally. (good if you read some stuff you dont want getting leaked or something)
Its a good alternative in comparison to online software as its fully free.
The book manager has three entries; Title, Author, Status. The Status has three options in a dropdown: (Read, Reading, Not Read)
It also has a sort feature so you can see what books you have read and not read and are reading.
You can also download and change the .py file to make it for your liking.
Ive added comments to the code so you can see what line of code does what and it makes it easier to modify.
